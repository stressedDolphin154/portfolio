                    In this project, we design a website for Vendoo, a startup aimed at easing the lives of online resellers
                    by centralizing online marketplaces, like Ebay and Poshmark, all onto one website. Vendoo allows users to import, create listings, and crosspost their items across mutiple online marketplaces.
                    We will sketch, choose a design, create
                    a low-fidelity wireframe, create high-fidelity mockups, receive critiques on our design, and conduct user testing.
                </p>

                    Vendoo is a startup purposefully designed to help streamline the process for vendors to track the sales of their various products across a wide range of platforms. For example, a seller wanting to reach a vast audience by selling products on ebay, etsy, Facebook Marketplace, etc. could utilize Vendoo to have all relevant information necessary for managing their business in one convenient place. Additionally, Vendoo provides its users with a compilation of trends that are occurring in the seller’s business. This allows the seller to make more informed choices as to where to direct their business, as well as increase their profitability in the long run. The interface we have chosen to design for Vendoo is a desktop, and we believe users would be impacted positively by this interface due to its ease of use and organized structure. Sellers in this modern world have to navigate through a flurry of competing markets, opening the door for mismanagement and disarray. With Vendoo’s efficient interface that provides all salient information in one place, sellers can manage their business better and move smoother through their entrepreneurial endeavor.

                    <p>After the best elements of each sketch had been chosen by our team, we then proceeded by creating Lo-Fi wireframes that encapsulated these designs. These wireframes allowed us to better visualize on a basic level, the structure of our interface which we were then able to translate into a Hi-Fi prototype.</p>

                            <li>Sell page could have preview on the left side</li>

                            <li>Navigation bar and hover effects its very welcoming to new users</li>
                            <li>Position of navigation bar and lines are inconsistent</li>

                            <li>Login and signup are shown to user at once; usually is shown seperately</li>
                            <li>There is no option to go back to sign-in page or to log out</li>

                <h1 id="main-section-p3-header">Part 3: User Testing</h1>

                <p>The overall task we wanted users to complete was to check the trends of a singular item. We chose this task to see if it was intuitive to click on the image to get a closer picture of the item. The testing instructions and questions were as follows: </p>
                <img src="iterative/user-testing-0.png" style="width: 80%; border: 2px solid #F85F75; border-radius: 5px; margin-left: 10%;">
                <p>After viewing the user testing videos the results of the testing were inline with our expectations. Most of the users when navigating to the trends page intuitively knew that clicking on the image of the shoe displayed a more in depth analysis of the trends. When thinking through their thought process and in the reflection all of the users like the site and felt that it was easy to navigate. One problem arose in our sign in subtask as one user struggled to figure out how to sign in. The user later on realized that they were signing into Figma and not our mockup site. There were no errors or issues on signing out as when they explored the website they all noted that the profile signed them out. Based on our UserTesting results and feedback the only change that we might make is making the sign in button bigger and bolder for the user to see on the home page.</p>
                <p>Here are the user testing videos:</p>
