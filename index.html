                    <p>the goal of this project was to explore how a user thinks and interacts with an interface. 
                        through interviews and observations i analyzed and created a storyboard of a mock user experience. this 
                        project helped me learn how to think like a user and create mental and conceptual models when designing.

                    <p> the goal of this project was to explore and learn about hifi prototyping. in a group we learned how to 
                        use Figma and created a mock up of an already known app, but for a difference purpose. this project is useful in the future for designing future mock up
                        applications using Figma.

                <p> this assignments builds on both personas and hifi prototyping. in a team we took a startup concept and created
                    a mock up design of what their web application would look like. this took using mental models and conceptual models
                    as well as the skills learned in figma to produce the final product.

                <p>using my design skills i created a website with a group to help solve a problem at brown university. this problem was creating a single
                    school calendar and detecting whether a place on campus is busy. using good ui design and assessing accesibility and safety we create 
                    the better brown u app.
