                    The interface I choose is the water filling stations in Wellness. 
                    Everyone has access to these as they are seen in Health Services 
                    although for my specific personas I focused on the ones in the dorm 
                    hallways. In this interface, you can fill water bottles and also drink 
                    from one of the two water fountains. You can activate the water to drink 
                    by the front or side buttons and the water for filling the water bottle 
                    is activated by a sensor.

                <h1 id="main-section-p2-header">recording observations</h1>
                <p>Watching the user interact with the interface I noticed some key things. 
                    Everyone who went to drink water pushed two buttons whether it was the two 
                    in the front or the two on the side. Height definitely played a factor in 
                    how easy the fountain was to use as those who were taller had difficulty 
                    leaning down to drink. Those using the water filter station acted in two 
                    manners. A lot kept their hand on their water bottle while it was filling 
                    while others stuck it underneath and paced around as it filled. When it 
                    came to removing the bottle, the bottle had either overflowed which 
                    indicated it needed to be removed or they stopped it with a small but 
                    noticeable amount left to fill.  </p>
                <h1 id="main-section-p2-header">interview summary</h1>
                <p> Questions:
                    <li>On a scale of 1 - 10 how easy do you find this interface to use?</li>
                    <li>Are there any components that are hard to understand?</li>
                    <li>Do you typically use the front or the side buttons?</li>
                    <li>Do push one or two buttons?</li>
                    <li>How often do you use the water filler?</li>
                    <li>How often do you use the drinking fountain?</li>
                    
                    Summary:
                    The average answers for how easy this interface was to use was a 3. However, only one person commented on a specific component that was hard to understand. This component was the water filler as there is no clear indication of how to stop the water from flowing, only to get started. The reasons for this interface not being the easiest to use was as a child it might be hard to understand at first that each fountain does the same thing and if you cannot read the instructions for the water filler you wouldnâ€™t know that it fills water bottles.
                    As stated in the observation everyone pushed two buttons although only one is need to get water flowing. There was an equal distribution of those who use the side buttons and those who use the front.
                    The use of the interface was split evenly between drinking and filling. Those who have a water bottle only ever used the drinking fountain to fill their water bottle up. They believed they averaged around 4 times a day filling their water bottles. The ones who used it entirely for drinking did not have water bottles. The come to the fountain multiple times a day to quench their thirst. However, if they had a water bottle they think they would stop coming just for a drink and more for filling up their water bottles.
